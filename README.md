# TextOnImageTranslator
An application to translate text in an alien language when visiting a tourist/unknown destination by pointing the camera at the text. The application will recognize the source language and convert it into a database of over 60 languages.
The application is based on a raspberry pi running OpenCV.
Tesseract-OCR adn ESpeak are used for conversion and audio output respectively.
Link to all the libraries are included in the Read_Instructions file.
The project uses the free Microsoft bing translation service and not the google translate service.
